# Example of advanced browser configuration
Here is an example of browser configurations that one or another might try.

### Download PDF and open outside the browser
The goal is to download a pdf file without being prompted and to have it open externally, outside of the browser.

#### Challenge - pdf
- Set Chrome preferences such that one is not prompted when downloading files
- Have the downloaded pdf be sent to an external viewer and not opened within the browser

#### Hint - pdf
If you are having trouble determine which Chrome Preferences might configure
chrome as described [this Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41877155/disabling-pdf-viewer-plugin-in-chromedriver)
may be of use.
